Bmlauncher.exe is the application that allows you to configure and start the game. It is located in the Binaries/Win32 folder of the game installation directory. If it is missing, you will not be able to play the game.
 
There are several possible reasons why Bmlauncher.exe may be missing. One of them is that you have moved or deleted the game folder to another location or drive. Another reason is that your antivirus software may have quarantined or deleted the file as a false positive. A third reason is that you have applied a crack or a patch that has overwritten or removed the file.
 
Fortunately, there are some solutions that can help you fix this issue and enjoy the game. Here are some of them:
 
- Verify the integrity of your game files on Steam. This will check if any files are corrupted or missing and download them again. To do this, right-click on Batman: Arkham City GOTY in your Steam library, select Properties, go to Local Files tab, and click on Verify Integrity of Game Files.
- Reinstall the game. This will ensure that you have all the necessary files and that they are not damaged or modified. To do this, uninstall the game from Steam, delete any remaining files in the game folder, and then install it again.
- Download Bmlauncher.exe from a trusted source. If you have lost or deleted the file by accident, you can try to find it online and download it. However, be careful not to download any malware or viruses disguised as Bmlauncher.exe. One possible source is [^1^], where a user has uploaded their own Bmlauncher.exe file for others to use.
- Use an alternative launcher. If you don't want to use Bmlauncher.exe or if it doesn't work for you, you can try to use another application that can launch the game with more options and features. One example is [^3^], which is a replacement application for the original Bmlauncher.exe that offers tooltips, startup movie toggle, and more.
- Use a crack or a patch. If you have applied a crack or a patch that has caused the Bmlauncher.exe error, you can try to use another one that works better. However, this is not recommended as it may violate the terms of service of Steam and the game developer, and may also introduce other problems or risks to your system.
